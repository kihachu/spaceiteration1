Space Iteration 1

By Bohdan Pasichnyk.

Description:
The "Space Simulator" project presents a 3D space simulation that includes asteroids, spaceships and celestial bodies. Users can interact with objects in virtual space, control a spaceship and collect resources from asteroids. The project includes elements of visualization and animation, creating a realistic space exploration environment.

The main functions of the project:
1. Control the spaceship with keyboard and mouse.
2. Interaction with asteroids including resource gathering.
3. Display of celestial bodies and starry background.
4. Implementation of camera control for movement in space.

Future plans:
- Added enemies that will destroy asteroids if necessary.

Starting the project:
1. Make sure you have the latest version of JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer.
2. Download and extract the project to a suitable location.
3. Open the project in your IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
4. Make sure all necessary libraries and dependencies are attached. If necessary, set the library paths in the project settings.
5. Find the main class containing the method `Main.java` ../src/main/java/com/kihachu/spaceiteration1/Main.java and run it.
6. jim3dsModelImporterJFX. The file is located in /src/main/resources/libs/jim3dsModelImporterJFX
6. The project will open in a new window where you will be able to interact with the 3D model of the universe.

In-game controls:

- Orientation of the ship:
 - `W` - Turn up (pitch up)
 - `S` - Turn down (pitch down)
 - `A` - Turning to the left (yaw left)
 - `D` - Turn to the right (yaw right)
 - `Q` - Roll left
 - `E` - Roll right

- Ship movement:
 - Up arrow (`↑`) - Move forward
 - Down arrow (`↓`) - Backward movement

Camera control:
- Hold the left mouse button to rotate the camera.
- Hold the right mouse button to rotate the camera.

Obtaining resources from an asteroid:
- Click on an asteroid within laser range to get resources.

If you experience startup problems, check your development environment settings and make sure all paths and dependencies are listed correctly.
